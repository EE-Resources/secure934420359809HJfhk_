**The new crew home of the Elven Empire (currently know as Xenia) will now be a center of housing for many recruits, as well as possibly higher ranks.**

A short an brief copy of this will be issued to the citizens, in much less detail telling them about where they live. The recruits will be asked about guilds, etc. and will be taken home.

## Guilds and Regions
The city will be split up into many regions depending on what the recruits prefer to do within Minecraft and the Elven Empire, adding different missions within guilds.
Goals:
- Separated housing
- Item trading common rooms for respective guild (trade ores, wood, fish, etc.).
- Preloaded items in chests depending 
- Area based resources (mines, farms).
- Wildlife zones for hunting and gathering
- Enclosed sailing areas for learning
- Other PirateCraft mechanic regions, such as brewing areas


## Inside of the Houses
As per Deofile's request, below is a list of items that Deckhand recruits should have within their homes waiting for them. These items will be inside their standard 6 double chest storage.
- A few stacks of pork chops
- A diamond axe to use to start off mining trees to earn a pickaxe
- A diamond sword for self defense, especially when mining
- A copy of a copy book that is a voucher for pickaxe
- A good set of diamond armor, not necessarily maxed as that could be a goal to work towards
- Guild dependent items like fishing rods, building supplies, or brewing materials


## The Trade Center
The city is intended to have trading walls for citizens and recruits, where citizens of their respective guilds can trade in ores or other harvested material for a currency or just strait up gear, removing the need for citizens/recruits to have money while also helping EE.

Examples of raw-to-material trades, as seen in nick's shop:
- 10 diamond ore for 24 diamond
- 10 gold ore for 24 gold
- 10 iron ore for 24 iron
- 10 redstone ore for 84 redstone
- 10 lapis ore for 156 lapis
- 10 copper ore for 84 ingot
- 10 coal ore for 24 coal

Examples of material-to-product trades:
- A stack of logs +  the voucher for a silk touch disposable pick
- 
- 32 Cod for a lure 3 rod
- 64 Diamonds for a fully enchanted diamond set

There will also be a brewing community/guild here, so they will have their own area where they have access to materials where they can trade finished potions for a currency that gets them more materials and other, wanted items for motivation.
